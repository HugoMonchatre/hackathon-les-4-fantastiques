# HACKATHON BACK TO THE FUTURE - NOV 2020

1. The pitch was:
“If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish
anything.”, Emmett Brown

Wilders have the power to travel back in time and bring all their technology with them. They can explore the period of their choice in order to create an application that can be perfectly adapted to the needs of the times, it can be Prohibition or Middle Ages, Roman Empire, Age of Enlightenment ...

We were given 29 hours to complete the mission.

2. Our team was competing with the campus of La Loupe (28), and we won the prize Special Mention of the Jury ("prix coup de coeur du Jury").

Our team included Sarah Quero, Damien Mauger, Valentin Broudin, Hugo Monchâtre and Thibaut Guibert.

3. Our idea was to solve the issue of road navigation during the Middle Ages, with no map nor GPS available for the common folks.
By using the API of GraphHopper, we were able to display road navigation instructions from a town to another that were given a user.

To keep with the pitch idea of time travel, we created a design similar to what could have been a web application with the style of Middle Ages.

4. Our application was built with React and was designed to be mobile first. Please enjoy the full experience by displaying it on mobile. We still made the app responsive but its use is optimal on smaller devices, as a navigation device should be.
